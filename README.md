This project is a "Hangman" game or "Word-Guess-Game".

    Ray Stevens: "Ahab the Arab"
    Steve Martin: "Athiests Don't Have No Songs"
    Steve Martin: "King-Tut"
The game starts with the push of any key.
The user guesses the first and last name of the artist one letter at a time. The names are case-sensitive.
Key-strokes are recorded. 
If you exceed 20 guesses and do not guess the correct name, the user is assigned one loss and the game repeats.
If the user guesses the correct characters for the artist's name, the user is assigned one win and the album cover is displayed and the artist's song plays.
Wins and losses are posted on the "board".
The game can be restarted by pressing the browser "recycle" button.
